My name is Shuyang Cao (曹书阳 in Chinese). I am a PhD student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at University of Pittsburgh, advised by Professors [Adam K Leibovich](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/adam-k-leibovich) and [Daniel Boyanovsky](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/daniel-boyanovsky).

My research interests lie within nonequilibrium dynamics in both cosmology and condensed matter physics. I use nonequilibrium dynamics to explore a broad range of physics aspects while other methods are also adopted when needed, such as quantum optics, topological physics. A wide spectrum of properties is studied in this exploration, for example, thermalization, decoherence, entropy production, energy-matter transport, entanglement and so on. My recent projects investigate nonequilibrium evolution of axion electrodynamics, field mixing in vacuum and thermal background, and binary coalescence related to gravitational waves.

Prior to Pitt, I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Science and Technology at Peking University in 2018. At PKU, I worked on precesion meausrements in cold atoms, advised by Prof. [Xiaoji Zhou](http://iqe.pku.edu.cn/dht/lyzyjmcl_01/yjry_02/zzjs_02/xiaoji_zhou_01/index.htm).
