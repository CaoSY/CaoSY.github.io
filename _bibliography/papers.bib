  abstract = {We introduce an effective field theory to study indirect mixing of two fields induced by their couplings to a common decay channel in a medium. The extension of the method of Lee, Oehme, and Yang, the cornerstone of analysis of CP violation in flavored mesons, to include the mixing of particles with different masses provides a guide to and benchmark for the effective field theory. The analysis reveals subtle caveats in the description of mixing in terms of the widely used non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, more acute in the nondegenerate case. The effective field theory describes the dynamics of field mixing where the common intermediate states populate a bath in thermal equilibrium, as an open quantum system. We obtain the effective action up to second order in the couplings, where indirect mixing is a consequence of off-diagonal self-energy components. We find that if only one of the mixing fields features an initial expectation value, indirect mixing induces an expectation value of the other field. The equal time two point correlation functions exhibit an asymptotic approach to a stationary thermal state, and the emergence of long-lived bath-induced coherence which displays quantum beats as a consequence of interference of quasinormal modes in the medium. The amplitudes of the quantum beats are resonantly enhanced in the nearly degenerate case with potential observational consequences.}

  abstract = {Axions mix with neutral pions after the QCD phase transition through their common coupling to the radiation bath via a Chern-Simons term,  as  a consequence of the $U(1)$ anomaly.    The non-equilibrium effective action that describes this mixing phenomenon  is obtained to second order in the coupling of neutral pions and axions to photons. We show that a misaligned axion condensate induces a neutral pion condensate after the QCD phase transition. The dynamics of the pion condensate displays   long and short time scales and decays on the longer time scale exhibiting a phenomenon akin to the ``purification'' in a Kaon beam. On the intermediate time scales the macroscopic pion condensate is proportional to a condensate of the abelian Chern-Simons term induced by the axion. We  argue that the coupling to the common bath also induces kinetic mixing.  We obtain the axion and pion populations, and these exhibit thermalization with the bath. The mutual coupling to the bath induces long-lived axion- neutral pion coherence independent of initial conditions.   The framework of the effective action and many of the consequences are more broadly general and applicable to   scalar or pseudoscalar particles mixing in a medium.}

  abstract    = {We obtain the non-equilibrium condensate of the Chern Simons density induced by a misaligned homogeneous coherent axion field in linear response.  The Chern-Simons dynamical susceptibility is simply related to  the axion self-energy,  a result that is valid to leading order in the axion coupling but to all orders in the couplings of the gauge fields to other fields within or beyond the standard model except   the axion. The induced Chern-Simons density requires renormalization which is achieved by vacuum subtraction. For ultralight axions of mass $m_a$ coupled to electromagnetic fields with coupling $g$,    the renormalized high  temperature  contribution post-recombination  is $\langle \vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}\rangle(t) =  -\frac{g\,\pi^2\,T^4}{15}    \,\overline{a}(t)+ \frac{g \,m^2_a\,T}{16\,\pi}\,\dot{\overline{a}}(t) $ with $\overline{a}(t)$ the  dynamical homogeneous axion condensate.  We conjecture that emergent axion-like quasiparticle excitations in condensed matter systems may be harnessed to probe cosmological axions and the Chern-Simons condensate. Furthermore, it is  argued that a misaligned axion can also induce  a non-abelian Chern-Simons condensate of similar qualitative form, and can also ``seed'' chiral symmetry breaking and induce a neutral pion condensate after the QCD phase transition.}

  abstract      = "We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of Axion-like particles (ALP) coupled to Standard Model degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium. The Quantum Master Equation (QME) for the (ALP) reduced density matrix is derived to leading order in the coupling of the (ALP) to the thermal bath, but to \textbackslashemph\{all\} orders of the bath couplings to degrees of freedom within or beyond the Standard Model other than the (ALP). The (QME) describes the damped oscillation dynamics of an initial misaligned (ALP) condensate, thermalization with the bath, decoherence and entropy production within a unifying framework. The (ALP) energy density $\mathcal\{E\}(t)$ features two components: a ``cold'' component from the misaligned condensate and a ``hot'' component from thermalization with the bath, with $\mathcal\{E\}(t)=\mathcal\{E\}_\{c\}\,e^\{-\gamma(T)\,t\}+\mathcal\{E\}_\{h\}(1-e^\{-\gamma(T)\,t\})$ thus providing a ``mixed dark matter'' scenario. Relaxation of the (ALP) condensate, thermalization, decoherence and entropy production occur on similar time scales. An explicit example with (ALP)-photon coupling, valid post recombination yields a relaxation rate $\gamma(T)$ with a substantial enhancement from thermal emission and absorption. A misaligned condensate is decaying at least since recombination and on the same time scale thermalizing with the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Possible consequences for birefringence of the (CMB) and (ALP) contribution to the effective number of ultrarelativistic species and galaxy formation are discussed."

  abstract = {We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a pseudoscalar axion-like particle (ALP) weakly coupled to degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium by obtaining its reduced density matrix. Its time evolution is determined by the in-in effective action which we obtain to leading order in the (ALP) coupling but to \emph{all orders} in the couplings of the bath  to other fields within or beyond the standard model. The effective  equation of motion for the (ALP)  is a Langevin equation with noise and friction kernels obeying the fluctuation dissipation relation. A ``misaligned'' initial condition yields  damped coherent oscillations, however, the (ALP)  population increases towards thermalization with the
bath. As a result, the     energy density features a mixture of a cold component from misalignment and a hot component  from thermalization with proportions that vary in time $(cold)\,e^{-\Gamma t}+(hot)\,(1-e^{-\Gamma t})$, providing a scenario wherein the ``warmth'' of the dark matter evolves in time from colder to hotter.  As a specific example we consider the (ALP)-photon  coupling $g a \vec{E}\cdot \vec{B}$ to lowest order, valid   from recombination onwards. For $T \gg m_a$ the long-wavelength relaxation rate is substantially enhanced $\Gamma_T  = \frac{g^2\,m^2_a\,T}{16\pi} $. The ultraviolet divergences of the (ALP) self-energy require higher order derivative terms in the effective action.  We find   that at high temperature, the finite temperature effective mass of the (ALP) is $m^2_a(T) = m^2_a(0)\Big[ 1-(T/T_c)^4\Big]$, with $T_c \propto \sqrt{m_a(0)/g}$, \emph{suggesting} the possibility of an inverted phase transition, which when combined with higher derivatives may possibly indicate  exotic new phases. We discuss possible cosmological consequences on structure formation, the effective number of relativistic species and birefringence of the cosmic microwave background.}

  abstract = {To extract useful information about quantum effects in cold atom experiments, one central task is to identify the intrinsic fluctuations from extrinsic system noises of various kinds. As a data processing method, principal component analysis can decompose fluctuations in experimental data into eigenmodes, and give a chance to separate noises originated from different physical sources. In this paper, we demonstrate for Bose-Einstein condensates in one-dimensional optical lattices that the principal component analysis can be applied to time-of-flight images to successfully separate and identify noises from different origins of leading contribution, and can help to reduce or even eliminate noises via corresponding data processing procedures. The attribution of noise modes to their physical origins is also confirmed by numerical analysis within a mean-field theory. As the method does not rely on any a priori knowledge of the system properties, it is potentially applicable to the study of other quantum states and quantum critical regions.},

In this work, we observe a two-dimensional oscillation by exciting atoms in one direction, where the atoms are transferred to an anharmonic region. Theoretical calculations are coincident to the experimental results. These oscillations in two dimensions not only can be used to measure trap parameters but also have potential applications in atomic interferometry and precise measurements.}
